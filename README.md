📱 Mobile Responsiveness
The website has been meticulously crafted to provide an exceptional mobile experience.

Adaptive Layouts: Every section, from the header to the footer, dynamically adjusts to fit the screen size perfectly.

Custom Mobile Menu: The desktop buttons are replaced by a sleek, custom-designed "wrench" icon that toggles a dropdown menu, saving valuable screen real estate.

Optimized Timeline: The skill timeline on mobile uses a clean, vertical layout, removing the complex desktop animations for better readability and performance.

Smart Navigation: The semi-circular navigation on the second page intelligently hides when not in use on mobile, providing an uncluttered view of the content.

Touch-Friendly: All interactive elements are designed with appropriate sizing and spacing for easy touch interaction.
